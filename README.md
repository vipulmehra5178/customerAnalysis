Description of the Customer Segmentation Analysis Code


Purpose:

 Analyzes customer spending patterns based on age using K-Means clustering and visualizes results with a scatter plot.

         
Libraries Used:

1.pandas: For data manipulation and loading the CSV file.

        
2.matplotlib.pyplot: For basic plotting (elbow curve and scatter plots).

        
3.seaborn: For enhanced scatter plot visualization with clusters.

        
4. sklearn.cluster.KMeans: For performing K-Means clustering.

        
What This Model Is:


A K-Means clustering model that groups customers based on age and spending behavior using the "Mall Customer Segmentation Data" from Kaggle.

        
What It Consists Of:


Uses unsupervised learning to identify natural clusters in the data without predefined labels, focusing on Age and Spending Score (1-100).

        
Insights We Can Gain:


 Identifies which age groups spend more or less (e.g., younger customers with high spending scores vs. older ones with lower scores).

        
Helps businesses target marketing efforts, like promotions for high-spending age segments or strategies to boost spending in low-scoring groups.

        
Reveals spending trends across age ranges, aiding in product placement or customer retention strategies.
